In order to further understand the dynamics of replication of Salmonella typhimurium in macrophages, a proof of concept model was constructed in R to simulate the changes in fluorescence distribution among a population using two fluorescence dilution (FD) techniques (TIMER and pDiGi). These models allowed experiments from Claudi et al. 2014 and Helaine et al. 2010 to be reproduced in silico, testing different hypothesis of population dynamics to find those which match data from the papers. The results of the models indicated a significant biased loss in addition to replication events from the intracellular Salmonella population (either by bacterial death or macrophage lysis) between 14 and 22 hours after phagocytosis by a bone marrow derived macrophage. Similar evidence was not found for immortalised RAW 246.7 macrophages. The model also allowed comparison between the two FD techniques in the context of the same experiment. Due to the short time frame of the experiment and the response lag of the TIMER system, it was concluded that in this case the pDiGi system was likely to be more useful in future testing.
